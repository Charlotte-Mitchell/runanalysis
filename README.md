# Instructions on how to use the run_analysis.R script on the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

## How to use the script

* Unzip the following 8 files into the working directory

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'y_test.txt': Test labels.

- 'subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

- 'subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

* Run run_analysis.R
* Review condensed_data and summary_data, as well as the output .txt file summary_data.txt
